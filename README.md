# **Holberton School**
A repository containing the tasks i did as assignments and exams  online at Holberton School, Silicon Valley, San Francisco Bay Area.




## **Note**

* I'm always exploring new ways to optimize code and improve system performance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with others.
* I hope that my examples and projects will be useful to those looking to learn more about Software engineering or those looking to improve their skills in this field.

* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.
